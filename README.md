# No Comment Explanation and Information
I'm going to share more information about nocom here, the parts that didn't make sense to put into a Fit script.

Edit 7 July 2021: I started writing the wiki page here

Edit 8 Feb 2022: I made the source code of nocomment-master public here

Here's the -250k to +250k overworld heatmap at 4K resolution:



# Suggested prereqs
The FitMC video

Also the teaser trailer is cool: YouTube (lower quality) â€¢ Discord (higher quality)

Also if you want to see very cool timelapses / renders of nocom data look at these two youtube channels

# Corrections to Fit's video
It did not cause an "out of memory" on 2b2t, but rather tick lag to the point where the PaperMC watchdog process would print out the stacktrace. Not a big deal though since the end result is the same (server crashes with stacktrace).
Fit implies that it was never used to lag / queue skip, but it was used that way as early as April 2018.
The order of events around BibleBot is incorrect, BibleBot was only locked in late 2020, more than a year AFTER Hause implemented the first packet limit. Not a big deal though. Perhaps this was god's way of showing that he was upset with this exploit. We'll never know for sure though.
I (leijurv) was only brought on in 2020. He didn't say explicitly, but he implied 2019.
Remote viewing was actually possible from the very beginning. For example, while it was implied that the dipper nation remote viewing screenshots were from my system, they were actually from the earlier method of simply clicking every block in the chunk. This was known and used from day 1, I cannot take credit for it. In fact, I wouldn't be told about nocom until over a year after those posts.
Obviously, this should go without saying, but the exploit cannot literally "predict the future". When Fit was talking about Beardler's stash/base, that has been misunderstood by a lot of people. What happened was that the exploit tracked many people to that location, it was keeping up with downloading the blocks at the base, and it saw a lot of TNT being placed. The conclusion of "this means the base is about to get griefed" was NOT made by the exploit or any autonomous software. Really, we caught wind that this was happening, and I pulled up the latest remote downloader data, and took those screenshots fit showed of builds covered in TNT. Obviously, I saw that and thought "it's about to be griefed". Later on, Fit asked for a timelapse render of accounts traveling to the location nether-side, which I also made from historical track data. We also were able to pull up who was most strongly associated with that base in the past, demonstrating that it actually was Beardler's stash (or, at least, that beardler's account was more active at that location than boofer's). So, on the one hand, it was fully autonomously collecting this data, such as players converging on the location and TNT placements, and that is data that we could view and connect the dots on to understand what happened, but it did not connect those dots itself. It's not like we got a automated notification "big base has a lot of TNT being placed on it right now" (although, to be clear, something like that would not have been difficult to create, an automated notification like that would have been perfectly possible given the data that we were collecting, we just... never decided to do that).
Other than that it is essentially perfectly accurate, Fit did an impressively good job editing it all together with all the media and such that we dumped on him. This video is different from most because the script was edited for clarity and technical correctness by all of us, and we worked closely together, such as making certain heatmap renders and timelapses based on what Fit wanted to show and talk about.

# Is my base compromised by nocom?
Did you:

Spend a nontrivial amount of time logged in at the base (leaving its chunks loaded) from mid July 2018 to August-ish 2019? (and the base is within the first few million out from spawn)
Travel to the base (at any distance from spawn) by any means other than teleporting, from late March 2020 to early July 2021? (such as by walking, elytra flying, boat phasing, anything)
If either of those is true, then more likely than not, yes it's in the database.
